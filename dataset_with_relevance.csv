When I first made this, I braised the chicken in the sauce and it came out a little tough (my stove is electric and it is hard to get the low temperature right.) The skin was rubbery, too. I decided I could achieve a crisper skin and a moister texture by searing the chicken on top of the stove and finishing it in the oven. This has the added benefit of speeding up the preparation time since you can make the sauce on top of the stove while the chicken is in the oven.

Turn out the dough onto the floured board or counter top. Sprinkle some extra flour on top of the dough. Just enough to make the dough easier for you to work with and not so sticky. You want to get it just to the not too sticky point but not add so much flour that they become dense. It is hard to say how much as this varies with the climate and humidity.,Knead lightly just until the dough is smooth-about 6 times. The less you handle it, the better the biscuits!,Pat into a square shape and make long cuts with a very sharp knife from top to bottom and then side to side--like a tic tac toe board and you will havce 9 biscuits. Add one extra line to make 12 squares. I usually cut to make 12, but make them as large or small as you like.,Place on lightly greased or sprayed cookie sheet just a tiny bit apart- about 1/2 inch- and bake at 450&deg;F for 15 to 20 minutes or until browned on top.,Brush the tops of biscuits with butter or spray with butter spray and serve immediately.,Note: Don't have any self-rising flour?

You can even add garlic powder and cheese to make those 'famous restaurant type' biscuits, BUT BETTER. Edited 8/08 to add yes these are basic biscuits. To add additional flavor try adding in herbs and seasonings as stated in the previous edit above. Onion powder, garlic powder, fresh cracked black pepper, herbs like oregano or rosemary. You could even brush the top with melted butter when done baking or add some Butter Buds or Molly McButter if you like. This also doubles very easily. and again 11-08 This dough is very wet and sticky. Make sure your hands are well floured and gently press into shape to knead- do not knead vigorously, you will have a mess. Gently pat and use a kneading motion to gently fold the dough into itself and form into a square shape.","Low Cholesterol,Healthy,Kid Friendly,Brunch,< 30 Mins,Oven,Easy,Inexpensive",179,2.5,5.1

My girlfriend had just graduated, and I had just finished my junior year of college. We rented a Renault 5, and drove through western Europe. In Italy, we spent a week staying at the Hotel Duomo in Orvieto. The hotel has been renovated since we stayed; when we were there it had cheap, basic accomodations, but you couldn't beat the price and the location. We spent the days exploring the surrounding area, including four days commuting into Rome, sixty miles to the south. Evenings, we had dinner at one of the small tratorias, and finished with gelati from Gelateria Pasqualetti. At dusk, which in the middle of summer was around nine o'clock, it seemed that the entire town would come out and stroll the streets. We would stroll along with them, Vera with her 'gianduia', hazelnut and chocolate gelato, and me with my 'limon e fragola', lemon and raspberry. As the sky dimmed, we walked past young couples, small knots of schoolkids, and couples with hands entwined, ancient beyond years. The ritual of the 'passeggiata', the evening stroll was compelling, and we didn't miss it, no matter how much touring we had done during the day. Some recipes I can taste in my head before I get them down in the kitchen, and on the page. This Lemon ice is one of those. Even thirteen years later, I judge my lemon ice as to how well it compares to the ones I had in Orvieto. The atmosphere may not be quite as good, but if I make it just right, I can feel the warmth radiating off the sun-warmmed buildings, four thousand miles away.","Dessert,Low Protein,Low Cholesterol,Healthy,< 15 Mins,Easy",169.6,0,0.1

Beets have been used as medicine and nutrition going back to ancient
Greek and Roman times. The greens from beets can be used in your
recipes and contains many important minerals. Try juicing both with
and without the greens to see which taste you prefer.
It is important to get the proportions correct with some vegetables
and most juicing experts recommend keeping a 1:4 ratio of beets
other vegetables. For example 1 beet for every 4 carrots, &frac14; beet for
every carrot.
The following recipe keeps this proportion. It also contains cucumber
which is very cooling and refreshing when juice solo or in combination
with other vegetables. Long used as a treatment for eyes in solid form

Beets
Beets have been used as medicine and nutrition going back to ancient
Greek and Roman times. The greens from beets can be used in your
recipes and contains many important minerals. Try juicing both with
and without the greens to see which taste you prefer.
It is important to get the proportions correct with some vegetables
and most juicing experts recommend keeping a 1:4 ratio of beets
other vegetables. For example 1 beet for every 4 carrots, &frac14; beet for
every carrot.
The following recipe keeps this proportion. It also contains cucumber
which is very cooling and refreshing when juice solo or in combination
with other vegetables. Long used as a treatment for eyes in solid form
the juice is said to be very good for your skin.","Low Protein,Low Cholesterol,Healthy,< 15 Mins,Easy",102.4,0.5,1.2

Knead the dough, by hand or machine, for about 5 minutes, until it's soft, smooth, and quite slack. Flour the dough and place it in a bag, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.,To make dough with a bread machine: Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for dough or manual, and press Start. Allow the dough to proceed through its kneading cycle (no need to let it rise), then cancel the machine, flour the dough, and give it a rest in a plastic bag, as instructed above.,To make dough with a food processor: Place the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in the work bowl of a food processor equipped with the steel blade.

Working with 4 pretzels at a time, place them in the pan with the baking soda/water, spooning the water over their tops; leave them in the water for 2 minutes before placing them on the baking sheet. This baking soda &quot;bath&quot; will give the pretzels a nice, golden-brown color.,Transfer the pretzels to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle them lightly with coarse, kosher, or pretzel salt, if desired. Allow them to rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.,Bake the pretzels for 8 to 9 minutes, or until they're golden brown.,Remove the pretzels from the oven, and brush them thoroughly with the melted butter.

The nut/craisin mix in the bottom helps with this.,Tip: I know the baking time is a little ambiguous, be we move around a lot and I've made this in several different ovens. It's hard to &quot;kill&quot; these. Just test the pears with a fork. When the tops get that pretty caramel color and they're soft, they're ready.,Tip: This works with any pear, just adjust the baking time depending on the firmness of the pear. Firmer=longer. I like Bartlett pears because they're fat and stand up on their own better.",5,1,"This is a perennial favorite for Thanksgiving! It's adapted from a recipe for Spiced Baked Apples by Lorraine Chausse on allrecipes. The pears make a really lovely presentation for dinner parties and can cook while you eat dinner.

You can easily turn these into herbed pitas by simply adding in some of your favorite herbs (fresh or dried) while you're kneading the dough. EDITED TO ADD:  You need to add only the amount of flour necessary to clean the sides of the bowl.  So, you might not need all of the flour listed.  Also, this is a flatbread, so it will not rise a lot - not at all like regular yeast bread.  It is also important to preheat the oven and just before you put the pitas in, flip them over.

This is a converted recipe from Dustbunni, and a recipe she found on the internet. This is what she had to say about them: When I landed on this recipe while surfing the web, I had to try it.

After, several batches, I don't press the dough into a rectangle anymore. I divide it into eight equal pieces and pat each piece into a 1/2&quot; thick round. Then, turn each round in dish of cornmeal.

Weight will determine how long to cook the roast.,Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator.&nbsp; Season meat as desired.&nbsp; Place seasoned meat in an uncovered roasting pan on a shelf in the bottom 1/3 of your oven.,Bake EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes PER POUND.  Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention. NOTE:.,IF YOU HAVE AN OVEN PROBE OR THERMOMETER THAT HAS A WIRE THAT GOES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE OVEN DOOR, BY ALL MEANS USE IT AND SET THE TEMPERATURE ALARM FOR 140 DEGREES.  REMOVE MEAT FROM OVEN WHEN ALARM ALERT GOES OFF (probably before an hour has expired).,Turn oven OFF and DO NOT open oven door for 45 to 1 hour, OR sooner IF you are using a probe thermometer and it alerts that internal meat temp is at 140 degrees.  Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices.  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist.,After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.,NOTE:******* For anyone questioning this method of cooking, it really does reach the proper internal temperature on a thermometer.  According to Sara Moulton on FoodTV, trichinosos is killed at 138 degrees, and 145 is a safe temperature for pork, although the USDA recommends 160 degrees (meat will be much drier).  If the center of the meat is not a little pink, it is overcooked!,VARIATION:&nbsp; To make Roasted Veggies along with the tenderloin, peel carrots and potatoes, and cut into about 1-inch cubes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Season as desired and drizzle with a little oil.&nbsp; Add vegetables to pan around (but NOT touching) pork tenderloin.&nbsp; Cook tenderloin as instructed above.&nbsp; The roasted potatoes and carrots should be done when the roast is done.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the size of the potatoes and carrots depending upon the weight of your tenderloin and how long you cook it.",5,434,"My #1 way to cook a pork tenderloin or a boneless pork loin because it's ALWAYS moist and tender.  It's easy and foolproof!  If you like, marinate the roast and rub with any seasonings that please your palate! 

So many people have asked me how long to cook tenderloins if they have &quot;more than one&quot; to cook, I wanted to give a simple response.  ANSWER:  So long as the tenderloins are NOT touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  Remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  EXAMPLE:  If cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes TOTAL.   This makes it a great entree recipe when having a dinner party for 8-12 people, or more.

Pour over the ginger ale. Cover and cook on LOW for about 12 hours. See Note2 below regarding amount of time needed!,Remove the meat, strain and save the onions, discard all liquid. With two forks, shred the meat, discarding any remaining fat, bones or skin. Most of the fat will have melted away.,Return the shredded meat and the onions to the crock pot, stir in the barbecue sauce. Continue to cook for another 4 to 6 hours on LOW.,Serve with hamburger buns or rolls and additional barbecue sauce. Any leftovers freeze very well.,TIP: freeze ready-made sandwiches - a scoop of meat on a bun, well-wrapped. These make a great quick meal or snack. To reheat, remove wrapping, wrap in a paper towel, and zap 1-2 minute in the microwave.,Note: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.,Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!,Note3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking. I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward.,Note4: my sister says this takes 2 hours in the Instapot.

Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.,When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.,Grease two bread pans with Crisco. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.,Mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size.,Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes. (gas oven).,When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled.

I find it easiest to prepare the ingredients first.  Slice, dice, puree, open cans etc.  For stronger garlic flavor, &quot;crack&quot; the garlic open about ten minutes before mincing to give the oils air exposure.  Use whichever ingredients you love most.  The more juicy your vegetables the less water you need as the sauce will thin as the vegetables cook.  It's easier to start with thick sauce and thin in out than to try to thicken the sauce later.

Instead of water for the quinoa, use a low salt vegetable stock (I used the water which remained after cooking an artichoke, but it could be anything, although I don't recommend commercial due to the salt thing).  

The guaram masala has a nice &quot;sweet&quot; taste which works well with the sweet potatoes.  You can add in a little more if you like it.  If you can't find it, your favorite curry powder will work.

Try to get a bell pepper that is a different color than the jalopeno.  Adds a visual dimension. Or, perhaps, helps those who don't want any heat to remove the jalopenos.

A little history from Christmas Corner-Traditions:
Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition for hundreds of years. The oldest references to fruitcake date back to Roman times, when the recipe included pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and raisins mixed into barley mash. 
In Europe in the 1700s, a ceremonial type of fruitcake was baked at the end of the nut harvest and consumed the following year to celebrate the beginning of the next harvest. 
In the 18th century in England, there were laws restricting the use of plum cake (the generic word for dried fruit at the time) to Christmas, Easter, weddings, christenings, and funerals. 
Between 1837 and 1901, fruitcake was popular. It is said Queen Victoria received a fruitcake for her birthday one year, and legend has it, she put it aside for a year as a sign of restraint, moderation, and good taste. It is the custom in England for unmarried wedding guests to put a slice of the cake, traditionally a dark fruitcake, under their pillow at night so they will dream of the person they will marry. 
Fruitcake is full of healthy nutrients. The fruit and fiber in fruitcake is loaded with anti-oxidants, molecules that protect cells from disease and damage. 
The cakes contain a lot of sugar which means that water activity will be low, which keeps mold from forming and makes the cake last a long time. 
A fruitcake can last several months. If there's no mold, it's safe to eat, even if it has been around a while. But fruitcakes can't last forever.","Breads,Fruit,European,Christmas,< 60 Mins,For Large Groups",240,12,3.9

from 50 Chowders: One-Pot Meals
¡ª Clam, Corn &amp; Beyond 
(Scribner, 2000)
This chowder has a relationship to New Bedford and the area New Englanders call South Coast, which includes that part of southeastern Massachusetts west of Cape Cod and a small piece of eastern Rhode Island. The area is ethnically diverse, with a large Portuguese population, but everyone, even those who aren't Portuguese, loves good food. I served this chowder recently to a group at Sakonnet Vineyards in Little Compton, Rhode Island. As soon as word got out that there waschouri&ccedil;o(a dry, spicy, garlicky Portuguese sausage) in the chowder, the crowd demolished it. Almost everyone in this region loves chouri&ccedil;o, which the locals pronounce &quot;shore-ee-soo.&quot; All over New England where the Portuguese have settled, chouri&ccedil;o is included in clambakes, clam boils, and other traditional Yankee fare.

With its translucent reddish broth and colorful pieces of bell pepper, tomato, chouri&ccedil;o, potato, fish, and cilantro, this Portuguese-style chowder is very enticing. It has a splendid aroma and a savory spicy flavor, making it an interesting and exciting alternative to milder creamy chowders.

For equipment, you will need a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot with a lid, a wooden spoon, a slotted spoon, and a ladle.","Low Cholesterol,Healthy,< 4 Hours",450.1,15.6,33

Put both halves cut side down on a foil lined baking sheet, loosely cover them with foil, and pop them in the oven for about an hour at 375.

As a precautionary measure, I recommend putting a foil-lined baking sheet on the rack below the bread so it doesn't get so much direct heat from the bottom heating element.,When you decide that the baking process has completed, cool the bread for about 10 minutes to let the anxiety build.

The result paired really well with the Salmon that I picked up at the fish market, but it left me wishing that I had made some more to have with carrots, pita or tortilla chips. One of the secrets of this recipe has to be the roasted garlic (been a theme for me lately), which makes this dip really creamy, as well as helps that flavor. In any case, I¡¯ll definitely be making this again and probably buying some eggplant and spinning this up and filling up empty hummus containers. This stuff would also go awesome with other types of fish or even on a roast beef sandwich. Give it a shot!
